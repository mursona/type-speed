            <h3>What is the difference between local storage and session storage?</h3>
            <p><strong>Local storage :</strong> is a more modern storage space for web pages. Its size capacity could reach up to 5MB/10MB, depending on browser. Information stored in local storage will not be deleted. One must delete them manually or wait for JavaScript to call localStorage.clear() or localStorage.removeItem(key) .</p>
            <p><strong>Session Storage :</strong> Unlike local storage, information in session storage will be deleted when the session ends, for example, closing browser.</p>

            <h3>What is the differences between Local Scope and Global Scope Variable In JavaScript?</h3>
            <p><strong>Global scope :</strong> Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A code block simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are examples of structure that create a code block. A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.</p>
            <p><strong>Local Scope :</strong> Unlike local storage, information in session storage will be deleted when the session ends, for example, closing browser.</p>

            <h3>How does the Event Loop works in JavaScript?</h3>
            <p>JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java.
            </p>
            <p>The event loop is a constantly running process that monitors both the callback queue and the call stack.</p>

            <h3>How many way to get undefined in javascript?</h3>
            <p>We will get undefined value if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value and when we call a non-existent property or method of an object. In the above example, a function Sum does not return any result but still we try to assign its resulted value to a variable. So in this case, result will be undefined.</p>
